Spam Detection Online: 
Description:
Developed an online spam detection system that classifies messages or emails as spam or ham (non-spam) using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The project focuses on enhancing digital communication safety by filtering unwanted or malicious content.

Key Highlights:

Preprocessed text data using techniques like lowercasing, stop word removal, stemming, and TF-IDF vectorization.

Trained classification models such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM for message classification.

Achieved high accuracy and precision in detecting spam with minimal false positives.

Built a simple web interface using Flask/Streamlit for real-time user input and prediction.

Evaluated models using confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Tools & Technologies:
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Flask/Streamlit, Jupyter Notebook

Goal:
To build a lightweight, efficient, and accurate spam filtering system that can be deployed in messaging platforms or email services.
